After my last experience with a delayed shipment and no response from customer service, I'm unlikely to buy here again.
Despite repeated inquiries, the lack of communication from the seller showed a lack of commitment to customer service.
The store's failure to update their product line in response to known issues shows a lack of commitment to quality and innovation.
After receiving incorrect items twice in a row, it became clear the seller's commitment to order accuracy was lacking.
