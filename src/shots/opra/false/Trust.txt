Given the mixed reviews and several complaints about product authenticity, I'm hesitant to make any purchase from this seller.
The product photos turned out to be misleading, eroding my trust in the seller's honesty and transparency.
I found discrepancies in the product descriptions across listings, which made me question the seller's reliability.
Noticing several negative reviews highlighting issues of counterfeit items, my trust in the seller's authenticity wavered.
