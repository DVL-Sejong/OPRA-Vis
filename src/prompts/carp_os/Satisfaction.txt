Second, deduce a diagnostics REASONING process from premises (ie, clues, input) that supports the assessment of the organizationâ€™s satisfaction (Limit the number of words to 130).
Third, determine the overall SATISFACTION of INPUT as True or False considering CLUES, the REASONING process and the INPUT.

INPUT: Very good and Quality of product selling, so very caring with customer support also.
CLUES: - True: "Very good", "Quality of product", "very caring with customer support". - False: None.
